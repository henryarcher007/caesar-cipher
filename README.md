# caesar-cipher
This is my first ruby project.-
 A quick explanation of what a caesar cipher is.
  It is a form of encrypting private messages, the pattern is an input of letters, and a second input of a number. Based off of what number was inputted it will take each letter and put it down the alphabet. As an example, caesar_cipher('a', 1) => 'b' or caesar_cipher('Hello World', 3) 
  => 'Khoor Zruog'.
 
 This is a Ruby only program, and it can only be ran via console.
